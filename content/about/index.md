## Who am I

Software engineering and automation (repetition ?) enthusiast.<br><br> 
My main interests are, in no particular order: 
- Go software development
- System administration
- Containers and orchestration
- Skateboard

## Why am I writing on this blog

I enjoy writing about topics I'm interested about and I believe there's nothing like sharing knowledge to deepen your understanding about something.
<br>Besides, much of what I've learnt was thanks to various blog posts so I also feel like it's only normal that I too share the thing I feel might (or not) interest others.
