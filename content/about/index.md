## Who

Software engineering and automation enthusiast.
<br> 
My main interests are, in no particular order: 
- Go software engineering 
- System administration
- Containers and their orchestration

## Why

I enjoy writing about topics I'm interested about and there's nothing like sharing knowledge to deepen your understanding about something.
<br>
Besides, most of my learning sources are various blogs so I wanted to try the exercice of sharing by writing succint post and I appreciate it so far.
