## Who

Software engineering and automation enthusiast.<br><br> 
My main interests are, in no particular order: 
- Go software development
- System administration
- Containers and orchestration

## Why

I enjoy writing about topics I'm interested about and believe there's nothing like sharing knowledge to deepen your understanding about something.
<br>Besides, most of my learning sources are various blogs so it's only normal that, I too, share the thing I feel might — or not — interest others.
